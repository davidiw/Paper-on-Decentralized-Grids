@article{ibm_autonomic_computing,
  abstract = {A 2001 IBM manifesto observed that a looming software
complexity crisis -caused by applications and environments that number into the
tens of millions of lines of code - threatened to halt progress in computing.
The manifesto noted the almost impossible difficulty of managing current and
planned computing systems, which require integrating several heterogeneous
environments into corporate-wide computing systems that extend into the
Internet. Autonomic computing, perhaps the most attractive approach to solving
this problem, creates systems that can manage themselves when given high-level
objectives from administrators. Systems manage themselves according to an
administrator's goals. New components integrate as effortlessly as a new cell
establishes itself in the human body. These ideas are not science fiction, but
elements of the grand challenge to create self-managing computing systems.},
